### Security Architecture

#### Current Implementation (MVP)

- **Data Storage:** Client-side localStorage only
- **Authentication:** None (planned for Q4 2025)
- **Encryption:** None required (local storage only)
- **Network Security:** Static hosting, no API endpoints

#### Planned Implementation (Q4 2025+)

- **Authentication:** OAuth2 with Google/Apple, JWT tokens
- **Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for all user data
- **API Security:** Rate limiting, input validation, HTTPS only
- **Data Storage:** Encrypted database with proper access controls

### Threat Assessment

For detailed threat analysis, see [simple-scribbles/SECURITY_THREATS.md](simple-scribbles/SECURITY_THREATS.md).

**Comprehensive Security Documentation:**

- üìÑ [Security Audit Report](docs/security-audit-report.md) - Complete code and infrastructure audit
- üìÑ [GDPR Compliance Report](docs/gdpr-compliance-report.md) - Full privacy compliance assessment
- üìÑ [Security Recommendations](docs/security-recommendations.md) - Best practices and action items
- üìÑ [Security Threats Analysis](simple-scribbles/SECURITY_THREATS.md) - Detailed threat modeling

**High Priority Risks:**

1. **Data Breaches** (Future) - Mitigated by end-to-end encryption
2. **Account Hijacking** (Future) - Mitigated by OAuth and 2FA
3. **XSS Attacks** - Mitigated by input sanitization and CSP headers

**Current Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW** (local-only storage, no authentication required)  
**Future Risk Level:** üü° **MEDIUM** (with proper mitigations in place)

### Security Controls

#### Implemented

- ‚úÖ Client-side data storage (no server-side exposure)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS deployment (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Dependency management and updates
- ‚úÖ Privacy policy and GDPR compliance

#### Planned (Q4 2025)

- üîÑ OAuth2 authentication implementation
- üîÑ End-to-end encryption for user data
- üîÑ API rate limiting and input validation
- üîÑ Security headers and CSP implementation
- üîÑ Regular security audits and penetration testing
