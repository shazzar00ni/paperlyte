# Paperlyte Style Guide

## Tone & Voice

- **Light, empowering, fast**: the app should feel invisible while using it.
- Avoid overwhelming jargon, menus, or unnecessary details.
- Encourage simplicity and user confidence.

## Copy Conventions

- Use present tense: "Start typing" not "You can start typing".
- Use active voice: "Save notes instantly" not "Notes are saved instantly".
- Keep sentences concise; minimize filler words.
- Highlight core actions with verbs: Create, Tag, Search, Sync.

## UI Conventions

- Minimal, distraction-free layouts.
- Consistent typography: H1-H3 hierarchy.
- Buttons: primary = blue (#00a2ff), secondary = grey.
- Form labels: clear; inline or placeholder text optional.
- Notifications: subtle, non-blocking, brief.

## Markdown Support

- Headings: `#`, `##`, `###`.
- Bold/Italic: `**bold**`, `_italic_`.
- Lists: `-` unordered, `1.` ordered.
- Links: `[text](url)`.

## Component Naming (SCSS / Tailwind)

- BEM for SCSS: `note-card__title`, `editor__toolbar`.
- Tailwind: consistent spacing & color tokens from design system.
- Responsive utilities: use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints.
