# Paperlyte Security Threats & Mitigations

## Known Risks

### 1. Data Breaches
**Risk:** Unauthorized access to user notes or metadata.  
**Mitigation:** End-to-end encryption for all notes before cloud sync; encrypted storage on server; strict access controls.

### 2. Account Hijacking
**Risk:** Compromised login credentials via phishing or brute-force attacks.  
**Mitigation:** OAuth with Google/Apple; strong password policies; optional 2FA.

### 3. Data Loss
**Risk:** Loss of notes due to sync conflicts, offline edits, or server downtime.  
**Mitigation:** Local caching in IndexedDB; conflict resolution on sync; automated backup system.

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk:** Malicious scripts injected via Markdown or note content.  
**Mitigation:** Sanitize user input; escape HTML content; Content Security Policy headers.

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
**Risk:** Attackers overload the server, affecting sync and editor performance.  
**Mitigation:** Rate limiting, caching, server autoscaling, and monitoring for unusual traffic.

### 6. Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities
**Risk:** Exploits through outdated dependencies (React, Tailwind, Supabase).  
**Mitigation:** Regular dependency audits; automatic security patching; minimal use of third-party code.

## Recommended Practices
- Conduct regular penetration testing.
- Encrypt all backups at rest and in transit.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Keep all libraries and dependencies up-to-date.
