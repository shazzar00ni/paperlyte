## Overview

The `dataService.ts` contains explicit TODOs for API endpoint migration planned for Q4 2025. We need to plan and specify the API architecture to prepare for this transition.

## Current TODOs in Code

**File**: `src/services/dataService.ts`

### Lines 51-55: Notes API Endpoints
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Replace with API calls in Q4 2025:
 * - GET /api/notes
 * - POST /api/notes  
 * - PUT /api/notes/:id
 * - DELETE /api/notes/:id
 */
```

### Lines 99-102: Waitlist API Endpoints  
```typescript
/**
 * TODO: Replace with API calls in Q4 2025:
 * - POST /api/waitlist
 * - GET /api/waitlist (admin only)
 */
```

## Migration Planning Requirements

### 1. API Specification Design
- [ ] Define REST API endpoints and HTTP methods
- [ ] Design request/response schemas (JSON)
- [ ] Plan authentication and authorization
- [ ] Specify error handling and status codes
- [ ] Design rate limiting and pagination

### 2. Data Migration Strategy
- [ ] localStorage to API data migration path
- [ ] Conflict resolution for sync scenarios  
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] User data export/import capabilities

### 3. Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Backend technology stack selection
- [ ] Database schema design (notes, users, sessions)
- [ ] Real-time sync mechanism (WebSocket vs polling)
- [ ] End-to-end encryption implementation
- [ ] Multi-device synchronization strategy

### 4. Security Requirements
- [ ] User authentication system (OAuth2/OIDC)
- [ ] API key management and rotation
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

## Proposed API Design

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout  
POST /api/auth/refresh
GET  /api/auth/profile
```

### Notes API
```
GET    /api/notes              # List user's notes
POST   /api/notes              # Create new note
GET    /api/notes/:id          # Get specific note
PUT    /api/notes/:id          # Update note
DELETE /api/notes/:id          # Delete note
POST   /api/notes/sync         # Sync local changes
```

### Admin/Waitlist API
```
POST /api/waitlist             # Join waitlist
GET  /api/admin/waitlist       # Admin: list entries
GET  /api/admin/analytics      # Admin: usage stats
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: API Specification (Q3 2025)
- Complete API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database schema design
- Security and authentication planning

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Q4 2025)  
- API server implementation
- Database setup and migrations
- Authentication system integration

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Q4 2025)
- Update dataService implementation
- Add sync conflict resolution
- Implement real-time updates

### Phase 4: Migration & Testing (Q4 2025)
- Data migration scripts
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Security audit

## Compatibility Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep localStorage as fallback during transition
- Gradual feature migration approach  
- User opt-in for cloud sync features

### dataService Abstraction Benefits
✅ **Current abstraction layer allows seamless migration**  
✅ **Component code won't need changes**  
✅ **Easy A/B testing between localStorage and API**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Improved performance with cloud sync
- [ ] Multi-device synchronization working
- [ ] End-to-end encryption implemented
- [ ] User adoption of cloud features >80%

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Data migration complexity
- User authentication UX disruption
- Performance impact during transition

**Medium Risk:**  
- Third-party service dependencies
- Scaling challenges with user growth
- Security vulnerabilities

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Phased rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing and backups
- Security-first design approach

## Priority

**Medium** - Critical for long-term success but not blocking current MVP development.

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed API specification document**
2. **Research backend technology options**
3. **Design database schema**
4. **Plan user migration experience**
5. **Set up development and testing environments**

## Additional Context

This migration is essential for:
- Multi-device synchronization
- Collaborative features (future)
- Advanced search and analytics
- Enterprise security requirements
- Scalable architecture for growth
