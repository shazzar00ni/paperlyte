## Overview

Paperlyte needs a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, linting, building, and deployment processes. This will ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable reliable deployments.

## Current State

**Status**: No CI/CD pipeline configured  
**Deployment**: Manual process  
**Testing**: Local development only  
**Code Quality**: Manual linting

## Required Pipeline Components

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Code Quality Checks
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run TypeScript compiler
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        env:
          NODE_OPTIONS: '--max-old-space-size=4096'
```

#### Security Scanning
```yaml
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Snyk security scan
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Audit npm packages
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```

#### Bundle Analysis
```yaml
  bundle-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Analyze bundle size
        uses: preactjs/compressed-size-action@v2
        with:
          repo-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
```

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)

#### Staging Deployment
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml  
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build application
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
        env:
          VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_POSTHOG_KEY }}
          VITE_SENTRY_DSN: ${{ secrets.STAGING_SENTRY_DSN }}
      
      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2.0
        with:
          publish-dir: './dist'
          production-deploy: false
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_STAGING_SITE_ID }}

          version: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
```

### 3. Quality Gates

#### Pull Request Checks
```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  pr-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Validate PR title
        uses: amannn/action-semantic-pull-request@v5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Check for breaking changes
        run: |
          # Custom script to detect breaking changes
          npm run check-breaking-changes
      
      - name: Performance regression test
        run: |
          npm run build
          npm run lighthouse-ci
```

#### Code Coverage Requirements
```yaml
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run test:coverage
      
      - name: Upload to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          fail_ci_if_error: true
          
      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: |
          # Fail if coverage drops below 80%
          npm run coverage:check -- --threshold=80
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment Variables
```bash
# .env.development
VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=dev_key_here
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=dev_dsn_here  
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
```

### Staging Environment Variables  
```bash
# Deployed via GitHub Secrets
VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=staging_key
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=staging_dsn
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.paperlyte.com
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

### Production Environment Variables
```bash
# Deployed via GitHub Secrets  
VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=production_key
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=production_dsn
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.paperlyte.com
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, auto-deploys to production
- **`develop`**: Integration branch, auto-deploys to staging  
- **Feature branches**: Must pass all checks before merge to develop

### 2. Release Process
1. **Feature development** → Feature branch → PR to develop
2. **Integration testing** → Staging deployment from develop  
3. **Release preparation** → PR from develop to main
4. **Production deployment** → GitHub Release → Auto-deploy to production

### 3. Rollback Strategy
- **Immediate rollback**: Revert Git commit + redeploy
- **Database rollback**: Not applicable (localStorage only)
- **Feature flags**: Disable problematic features remotely

## Quality Assurance Automation

### 1. Automated Testing
- **Unit tests**: Run on every commit
- **Integration tests**: Run on PR creation  
- **E2E tests**: Run before production deployment (future)

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **Lighthouse CI**: Performance budget enforcement
- **Bundle size limits**: Prevent bloat with automated checks
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor and alert on regressions

### 3. Security Automation  
- **Dependency scanning**: Snyk + GitHub Security  
- **Code scanning**: CodeQL analysis
- **License compliance**: Check for license violations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic CI Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Set up basic linting and type checking
- [ ] Configure environment secrets  
- [ ] Test CI pipeline with sample changes

### Phase 2: Testing Integration (Week 2)  
- [ ] Resolve Vitest memory issues  
- [ ] Integrate test running in CI
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure quality gates

### Phase 3: Deployment Automation (Week 3)
- [ ] Set up Netlify deployment integration  
- [ ] Configure staging and production environments
- [ ] Test deployment pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Security scanning automation  
- [ ] Bundle analysis and optimization
- [ ] Release automation

## Monitoring & Alerting

### 1. Build Notifications
- **Slack integration**: Notify team of build status
- **Email alerts**: For production deployment issues  
- **GitHub status checks**: Block merging on failures

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **Lighthouse scores**: Track performance metrics over time
- **Bundle size alerts**: Notify when bundle grows significantly  
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor user experience metrics

### 3. Error Tracking
- **Sentry integration**: Automatic error reporting from CI/CD  
- **Failed deployment alerts**: Immediate notification of deployment failures
- **Rollback triggers**: Automatic rollback on critical errors

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Zero-downtime deployments** achieved  
- [ ] **Automated quality checks** prevent regressions
- [ ] **Fast feedback loops**: CI completes in <5 minutes
- [ ] **Deployment confidence**: 99%+ successful deployments
- [ ] **Developer productivity**: Faster time from code to production
- [ ] **Security**: No high-severity vulnerabilities in production

## Tools & Services Required

### Free Tier Options
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- **Hosting**: Netlify (free tier sufficient for MVP)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (free developer tier)  
- **Security**: Snyk (free for open source)

### Paid Services (Future)  
- **Advanced monitoring**: DataDog or New Relic
- **Performance testing**: Lighthouse CI Pro  
- **Security scanning**: Snyk Pro
- **Code quality**: SonarCloud

## Priority

**Medium-High** - Essential for reliable development workflow and production deployments.

## Dependencies

⚠️ **Blocked by**: Test memory issues need resolution first  
✅ **Ready**: Repository structure and basic scripts are in place

## Additional Context

A robust CI/CD pipeline provides:  
- **Quality assurance** through automated testing
- **Faster deployment** with reduced manual steps  
- **Risk mitigation** through staged rollouts
- **Developer confidence** in making changes
- **Professional development workflow** for contributors

This investment will pay dividends as the project scales and adds more contributors.
