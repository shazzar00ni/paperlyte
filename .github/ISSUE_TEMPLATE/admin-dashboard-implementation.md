## Feature Description

The `AdminDashboard.tsx` component currently contains mock data comments and needs to be implemented with real administrative functionality or removed if not needed for MVP.

## Current State

**File**: `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
**Issue**: Contains "Mock data" comments indicating incomplete implementation

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Implement Real Admin Features

- **Waitlist Management**: Display and manage waitlist entries from `dataService`
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Show real usage metrics from PostHog/analytics
- **Note Statistics**: Display storage usage, note counts, etc.
- **User Management**: Basic user administration (future scope)

### Option 2: Remove Admin Dashboard

- Remove the admin route and component if not needed for MVP
- Clean up navigation and routing references
- Document removal in roadmap

## Implementation Details

If implementing real functionality:

```typescript
// Example real data integration
const AdminDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const [waitlistEntries, setWaitlistEntries] = useState<WaitlistEntry[]>([])
  const [noteStats, setNoteStats] = useState<NoteStats>({})

  useEffect(() => {
    loadWaitlistData()
    loadNoteStatistics()
  }, [])

  // Real data loading functions
}
```

## User Stories

**As an admin, I want to:**

- View waitlist entries and their details
- See usage statistics and analytics
- Monitor application health and performance
- Export data for analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove all "Mock data" comments and placeholder content
- [ ] Implement real data loading from `dataService`
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Include analytics tracking for admin actions
- [ ] Add proper authentication/authorization (if keeping)
- [ ] Responsive design matching app standards

## Technical Requirements

- Use existing `dataService` abstraction
- Follow component patterns from other pages
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add error monitoring integration
- Implement proper access control

## Priority

**Medium** - Not blocking MVP but affects code quality and future development.

## Additional Context

Current admin dashboard route exists at `/admin` but functionality is incomplete. Decision needed on scope for MVP vs future roadmap.

Related to Q4 2025 API migration planning - admin features may be more relevant post-API implementation.
