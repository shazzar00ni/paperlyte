## 🎯 Performance Issue Summary

**Current Lighthouse Performance Score:** 56/100 ⚠️ (Target: >90)

### Core Web Vitals Issues

- **First Contentful Paint:** 10.6s ❌ (Target: <1.8s)
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** 19.5s ❌ (Target: <2.5s) 
- **Speed Index:** 10.6s ❌ (Poor)
- **Total Blocking Time:** 40ms ✅ (Good)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** 0 ✅ (Excellent)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Performance Bottlenecks

- [ ] **Bundle Size Issues**
  - Large JavaScript bundles blocking initial render
  - Unused dependencies increasing bundle size
  - Missing code splitting and lazy loading

- [ ] **Resource Loading**
  - Unoptimized images or SVGs
  - Missing resource preloading
  - Inefficient CSS delivery

- [ ] **Rendering Performance**
  - Excessive re-renders in React components
  - Missing React.memo optimizations
  - Inefficient component lifecycle management

## 🛠️ Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1: Bundle Optimization

- [ ] Analyze bundle composition with `npm run build -- --analyze`
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Optimize Tailwind CSS purging

### Phase 2: Resource Optimization

- [ ] Optimize SVG icons and images
- [ ] Implement resource preloading
- [ ] Add service worker for caching
- [ ] Optimize font loading strategy

### Phase 3: React Performance

- [ ] Add React.memo to expensive components
- [ ] Optimize useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Implement useMemo/useCallback where needed
- [ ] Profile component render performance

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] Lighthouse Performance Score: >90
- [ ] First Contentful Paint: <1.8s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- [ ] Speed Index: <3.0s
- [ ] Bundle size reduction: >30%

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- [ ] Set up performance monitoring in CI
