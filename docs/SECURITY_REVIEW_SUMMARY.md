### Privacy & Data Protection

**Current Architecture:** Local-only storage  
**Risk Level:** üü¢ MINIMAL

**Privacy Controls:**

- ‚úÖ Data stays on user's device
- ‚úÖ No server-side data storage
- ‚úÖ Minimal data collection (waitlist only)
- ‚úÖ Analytics respects Do Not Track

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: üü¢ LOW

**Rationale:**

- Local-only data storage eliminates most risks
- No authentication = no credential attacks
- No database = no data breach risk
- Static hosting = minimal attack surface
- Zero vulnerabilities in dependencies

**Risk Breakdown:**

- Data Breach: Very Low (local storage only)
- Privacy Violation: Very Low (comprehensive controls)
- XSS Attacks: Low (mitigated with DOMPurify + CSP)
- Dependency Vulnerabilities: Very Low (0 found)
- Regulatory Non-compliance: Very Low (GDPR compliant)

### Future Risk Level: üü° MODERATE (with mitigations)

**For Q4 2025+ (cloud features):**

- Authentication Attacks: Medium (OAuth + MFA planned)
- Data Breaches: Medium (E2E encryption planned)
- API Attacks: Medium (rate limiting planned)
- Service Availability: Low (redundant infrastructure planned)

**All future risks have mitigation strategies planned.**
