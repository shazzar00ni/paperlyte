# Data Persistence Strategy

## Overview

Paperlyte uses a phased approach to data persistence, designed to enable rapid MVP development while ensuring smooth migration to production-grade infrastructure.

## Current Implementation (MVP Phase - Q3 2025)

### Storage Method
- **Technology**: Browser localStorage
- **Rationale**: Enables rapid prototyping and user testing without backend infrastructure
- **Location**: Client-side only (browser storage)

### Limitations
- **Device-specific**: Data is tied to the specific browser/device
- **No cross-device sync**: Notes don't sync between devices
- **Storage limits**: ~5-10MB per domain (varies by browser)
- **Data volatility**: Data can be lost if browser storage is cleared
- **No backup**: No automatic backup or recovery mechanisms

### Data Abstraction Layer

We've implemented a `DataService` abstraction layer (`src/services/dataService.ts`) that:

```typescript
// Current implementation uses localStorage
const notes = await dataService.getNotes()
await dataService.saveNote(note)
await dataService.addToWaitlist(entry)
```

This abstraction ensures that when we migrate to API-based storage, component code won't need to change.

## Planned Migration (Q4 2025)

### Future API Implementation
The data service will be updated to use REST API endpoints:

```typescript
// Future implementation will use HTTP calls
GET    /api/notes           // Load user notes
POST   /api/notes           // Create new note
PUT    /api/notes/:id       // Update existing note
DELETE /api/notes/:id       // Delete note

POST   /api/waitlist        // Join waitlist
GET    /api/waitlist        // Admin: list entries
```

### Migration Benefits
- **Cross-device sync**: Access notes from any device
- **Data durability**: Server-side persistence with backups
- **User accounts**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Scalability**: Support for millions of users
- **Advanced features**: Collaboration, version history, etc.

## User Experience Considerations

### Current User Warnings
- Users see a dismissible warning about data persistence limitations
- Warning appears in bottom-right corner after 2 seconds
- Can be permanently dismissed per device

### Data Export
- Admin dashboard provides real-time data export functionality
- Exports include both notes and waitlist data
- JSON format for easy migration to future API

## Technical Implementation

### Data Service Architecture
```typescript
class DataService {
  // Generic storage operations
  private getFromStorage<T>(key: string): T[]
  private saveToStorage<T>(key: string, data: T[]): boolean
  
  // Notes operations (will become API calls)
  async getNotes(): Promise<Note[]>
  async saveNote(note: Note): Promise<boolean>
  async deleteNote(noteId: string): Promise<boolean>
  
  // Waitlist operations (will become API calls)
  async addToWaitlist(entry): Promise<{success: boolean; error?: string}>
  async getWaitlistEntries(): Promise<WaitlistEntry[]>
  
  // Utility operations
  async exportData(): Promise<{notes: Note[]; waitlist: WaitlistEntry[]}>
  async getStorageInfo(): Promise<StorageInfo>
}
```

### Error Handling
- All data operations include comprehensive error handling
- Errors are logged to Sentry with context
- Graceful fallbacks for storage failures
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous operations simulate future API calls
- Minimal data processing overhead
- Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization
- Storage size monitoring and warnings

## Migration Timeline

### Q3 2025 (Current - MVP)
- ✅ localStorage implementation
- ✅ Data abstraction layer
- ✅ User warnings about limitations
- ✅ Export functionality

### Q4 2025 (API Migration)
- [ ] Backend API development
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Data migration scripts
- [ ] API integration in DataService
- [ ] Cross-device sync testing

### 2026 (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] Version history
- [ ] Advanced search
- [ ] Import from other services

## Development Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Always use DataService**: Never directly access localStorage in components
2. **Handle async operations**: All data operations return Promises
3. **Include error handling**: Always catch and handle data operation errors
4. **Test with storage limits**: Test app behavior when localStorage is full
5. **Plan for API migration**: Design components assuming network latency

### For Designers
1. **Account for loading states**: All data operations are async
2. **Design offline experiences**: Consider what happens when storage fails
3. **Plan migration UX**: How to communicate when API migration happens
4. **Consider storage warnings**: Design around persistence limitation messaging

## Security Considerations

### Current (localStorage)
- Data stored in plain text in browser
- No server-side security concerns
- User responsible for device security

### Future (API)
- End-to-end encryption planned
- Server-side data protection
- Secure authentication required
- GDPR compliance for EU users

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Current Tracking
- Storage usage and limits
- Data operation success/failure rates
- User behavior around persistence warnings
- Export functionality usage

### Future Tracking
- API response times
- Sync conflict resolution
- Cross-device usage patterns
- Data migration success rates

**Note**: This phased approach allows us to validate the product concept with real users while building toward a production-ready infrastructure. The abstraction layer ensures minimal disruption during the migration phase.
