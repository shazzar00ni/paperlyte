Start with these essential shortcuts:

Good titles make finding notes easier:

- ‚úÖ **Good:** "Meeting Notes - Project Alpha - Oct 3"
- ‚úÖ **Good:** "Recipe - Grandmother's Chocolate Cake"
- ‚ùå **Avoid:** "Notes", "Untitled", "Stuff"

### 3. Write Naturally First

- Come back and format later using the toolbar
- Focus on capturing ideas quickly

### 4. Search is Your Friend

- Use the search box to find notes quickly
- Search looks through both titles and content
- Partial words work: "meet" will find "meeting"

### 5. Leverage Markdown

If you know Markdown, you can type:

- `# Heading` for headers
- `**bold**` for bold text
