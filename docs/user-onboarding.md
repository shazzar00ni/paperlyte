The fundamental unit in Paperlyte. Each note has:
- **Title** - A descriptive name for quick identification

- **Tags** - Organizational labels for grouping and filtering
- **Metadata** - Created/modified dates, word count, etc.

### Tags

Flexible organization system that allows:
- Multiple tags per note
- Hierarchical organization (`project:feature:detail`)
- Quick filtering and searching
- Status tracking (`#todo`, `#done`)

### Search

Powerful instant search across:
- Note titles
- Note content
- Tags
- Metadata

### Auto-Save

Everything saves automatically:
- Changes save as you type
- No "save" button needed (but `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` works too)
