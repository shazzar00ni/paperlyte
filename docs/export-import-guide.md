{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportDate": "2025-10-03T10:30:00Z",
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": "note_123456789",
      "title": "My Important Note",
      "content": "Note content with **formatting**",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-01T14:22:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T09:15:00Z",
      "tags": ["work", "project-alpha"],
      "formatVersion": "richtext-v1"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalNotes": 1,
    "exportType": "complete"
  }
}
```
